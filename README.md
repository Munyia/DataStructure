# Algorithms Readme

This repository contains pseudocode for three algorithms related to sets and vectors.

## Problem 1: SumOfDistinctElements

### Description
The `SumOfDistinctElements` algorithm calculates the sum of distinct elements from two sets (`set1` and `set2`). It uses nested loops to compare elements and accumulate the sum.

### Usage
1. Provide values for `set1` and `set2`.
2. Run the algorithm.
3. The algorithm calculates and prints the sum of distinct elements.

## Problem 2: Dot Product and Orthogonal Vectors

### Procedure: procedure_name

#### Description
The `procedure_name` procedure calculates the dot product of two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) and stores the result in the variable `total`.

#### Usage
1. Call the procedure, providing values for `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. The procedure calculates the dot product, and the result is stored in `total`.

### Function: dot_product

#### Description
The `dot_product` function calculates the dot product of two arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) and returns the result.

#### Usage
1. Call the function, providing values for `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. The function returns the computed dot product.

### Algorithm: orthogonal

#### Description
The `orthogonal` algorithm checks if vectors (`v1`, `v2`, and `v3`) are orthogonal based on their dot products.

#### Usage
1. Provide values for vectors `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`.
2. Run the algorithm.
3. The algorithm checks and prints the orthogonal relationships between vectors.
